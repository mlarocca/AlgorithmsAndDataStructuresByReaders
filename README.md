# AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresByReaders

![Book Cover](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresByReaders/blob/master/images/LaRocca-ADS-MEAP-low.png)

Algorithms and Data Structures, coded by readers of ["Algorithms and Data Structures in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-action#toc)

> **Note**
>
> All code in this repo is uploaded by readers and it's **NOT** curated by the author or Manning.
> This is meant as a place to share code in more languages than a single author could possibly write: check all code and **use it at your own risk**.

If you'd like to take a look at the code provided with the book (mainly in Python, JavaScript and Java), check out the official [repo for the book](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresInAction). 

## Instructions to Upload Code

0. Clone this repo
1. Create a new branch
2. Upload your code in the folder `/<data structure>/<programming language>/<your username>`
   For instance, if your username is `hsimpson` and you are uploading a Java version of Treaps, create folder `/Treaps/Java/hsimpson`
   You might have to create a new folder if you are the first one to add a missing programming language; the folder structure inside your folder is up to you. 
3. Make sure you pass the tests for the given _DS_. Check [here](https://github.com/mlarocca/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresByReaders/edit/master/tests/README.md) to see how. You might have to write tests to your language of election, or adapt them to match your API: feel free to share them, within your folder  
4. When all tests pass, push your branch and create a pull request.
